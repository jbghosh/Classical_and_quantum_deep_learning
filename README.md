# Classical and quantum deep learning 
We implement three anomaly detection methods using machine learning and deep learning, namely isolation forest, auto encoder and hybrid quantum-classical auto encoder. The models are developed using PyTorch and Qiskit.

implemented the classical and quantum-classical hybrid autoencoder using the dataset small_data_5000.npy, which is corresponding to the case for $V_0$=0.3 in the 

## Anomaly_detection_dataset_V_0.9.ipynb
implemented the classical and quantum-classical hybrid autoencoder using the dataset big_data_5000.npy, which is corresponding to the case for $V_0$=0.9
