# Classical and quantum deep learning 
We implement three anomaly detection methods using machine learning and deep learning, namely isolation forest, auto encoder and hybrid quantum-classical auto encoder. The models are developed using PyTorch and Qiskit. Relevant publications: 1. [ [arXiv:2304.08616] ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08616) 2.  [ [Quantum Mach.
